1. Edit config.txt to change Game Install, Alternative Version, and Current Version directory paths.

	- Note: config.txt [PATHS] definitions:
	  
		GTAV_DIR  
		--------  
		Path to the game directory required to install game versions.  
		  
		ALT_VERSION_DIR  
		---------------  
		Directory to swap to an alternate version of the GTA V install (e.g., old game version, VR mod). Default files required to run the current version and update GTA V are moved to `default_files_backup` in the game directory.  
		  
		CURRENT_VERSION_DIR  
		-------------------  
		Directory containing files to be transferred to the game directory for use with the current version of GTA V (e.g., ini, dll).  

		This directory can remain empty, though there should be a folder indicated.  

		These files will remain in the chosen directory for restoration and indexing. The files will be deleted from or copied to the game directory depending on the game version state.  

		SETTINGS_DIR  
		------------  
		Location of the settings folder containing the GTA V `settings.xml`.  

2. Place a custom settings.xml file in the appropriate folder based on the game version used (Alt Version or Current Version).

3. Run GTA5 Version Switcher.bat to install or remove an alternative version of GTA V (e.g., old game version, VR). 

	- Note: Upon installation, AltVersionList.txt and CurrentVersionList.txt are created in the same folder as the batch file. These files index the "Alt Version" and "Current Version" folders, which are used for future uninstalls.
